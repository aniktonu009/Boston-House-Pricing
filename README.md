In this Project, we will predict a house price prediction system using Machine Learning with Python. So, our goal is to build a house price prediction system using machine learning.  Okay so let's try to understand how we are going to do this. First, let us see the workflow of this project.
1.	OUR DATA WILL BE Boston house price Data. 
2.	As we cannot directly feed the data on ML, we must do lots of pre-processing steps to feed our data. 
3.	Then analysis basics data step, model selection.
4.	 Also, we will feed XGBoost Regressor to feed our data into ML
5.	Then evaluate our test data.
